# My Node.js Project with GitHub Actions  

This project is a basic Node.js application with an automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.  

## What I Did  
- Created a Node.js project.  
- Set up GitHub Actions for automatic testing and deployment.  
- Pushed the project to GitHub.  

## How the Workflow Works  
1. When I push changes, GitHub Actions starts automatically.  
2. It installs dependencies and runs tests.  
3. If everything is fine, it deploys the project.  

## How to Run This Project  
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/karishsr/Task-1.git
   cd https://github.com/karishsr/Task-1.git
